Problem:
Majumdar, Khanna and Rawat have been invited to the 20th Annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Los Angeles, because of their exceptional skills in the field of Machine Learning. The investors in the summit are curious to know about the various incubating startups that are participating in the summit, and are also interested in funding them, if they are impressed by their work.

The organisation team of the event has the data of all the companies that participated in the previous editions and also some outsourced data about other startups. They are willing to share the data with our three friends, provided they help investors in deciding whether they should invest in a particular startup or not.

Can you help our three friends in their task?
